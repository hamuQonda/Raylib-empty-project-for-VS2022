# Raylib empty project for Visual Studio 2022
> <h3>Features</h> :  <br>It's easy to use. When creating a new project in VS, simply select the template "Raylib_Empty_Project" to create a new, empty Raylib-enabled project with any name and location.


## Setting the template in VS2022
1. Click the green button to download the ZIP file.
Unzip the ZIP file to find "Raylib_Empty_Project.zip." Do not unzip this file. We'll use it as is in the next step.

2. Placing "Raylib_Empty_Project.zip" in VS
<br>First, find the location of your VS project templates folder.
Launch Visual Studio, select "Tools" -> "Options" from the menu, and click "Locations" under "Projects and Solutions" in the list on the left. You'll see the "User Project Templates Location" on the right. Copy that path, open it in Explorer, and place "Raylib_Empty_Project.zip" there.<br>

### There are two prerequisites:
1. Raylib must be installed using ' [raylib Windows Installer ](https://www.raylib.com/)'.
2. After installation, have you built the raylib project? You'll need the raylib.lib generated by the build, so please build it once in both Debug and Release modes.
<br><br>
2.1 How to Build raylib for Visual Studio<br>
Open C:\raylib\raylib\projects\VS2022\raylib.sln in Visual Studio.<br>
Set it to Release configuration, right-click the 'raylib' project in Solution Explorer, and click Build from the drop-down list to build it.<br>
Next, change it to Debug configuration and build it using the same steps.<br>
<br><br>

# Ready?
When you create a new project using Raylib_Empty_Project, an empty project (with Raylib already configured) will open, as shown in the image below.<br>

# Let's start your raylib coding adventure from scratch!
Alright! Let's add the main.c file to the project and write a simple "Hello World!" program!<br>
  ```
    #include "raylib"

    int main() {
      InitWindow(800, 600, "Hello, raylib world");
      SetTargetFPS(60);

      while (!WindowShouldClose()) {
        BeginDrawing();
        ClearBackground(RAYWHITE);

        DrawText("Hello, raylib world !", 150, 250, 60, PINK);

        EndDrawing();
      }

      CloseWindow();
      return 0;
    }
  ```
